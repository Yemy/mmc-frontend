About Mulu Mesfin Charity (MMC)
Mulu Mesfin Charity (MMC) is a non-governmental, non-profit organization founded in August 2024 by Sister Mulu Mesfin, a nursing professional serving at the One-Stop Center of Ayder Specialized Referral Hospital. Inspired by her frontline experience during the devastating conflict in Tigray, Sister Mulu emerged as a strong advocate and voice for women affected by sexual and gender-based violence (sGBV) through local and international media. MMC was established to respond to the urgent needs of survivors, vulnerable women, and internally displaced persons by providing survivor-centered support, empowerment programs, and community-based interventions that uphold dignity, justice, and resilience.
